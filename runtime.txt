Runtime Analysis

1. **Boid Initialization**
   - **Complexity**: O(n)
   - **Description**: Initializes each boid with random position and velocity.

2. **Grid Update**
   - **Complexity**: O(n)
   - **Description**: Updates the spatial grid with current boid positions.

3. **Force Calculation**
   - **Complexity**: O(n * m)
   - **Description**: Calculates forces for each boid based on neighbors, where m is the average number of neighbors.

4. **Boid Update**
   - **Complexity**: O(n)
   - **Description**: Updates position and velocity of each boid based on calculated forces.

5. **Rendering**
   - **Complexity**: O(n)
   - **Description**: Draws each active boid in the simulation.

## Notes
- **n**: Number of boids in the simulation.
- The use of OpenMP parallelizes many operations, effectively reducing the time for these computations.
